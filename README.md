The repo is used to store some scripts written by me with JavaScript. By now, it has these tools below:
##  OneClock-for-JSBox
Inspired by OneClock on AppStore, I just made one with JSBox. It severs as an Always On Display clock:

As you can see, it has two themes.Double tap to switch between them.

## LottieViewer
As you can guess, it's a tool used to view Lottie animations. You can simply view a Lottie animation by scanning QRCode, copying urls, sharing it from PC/Mac or just downloading it from builtin browser. For more practical usages, you can view an animations between frame A and Frame B.Also you can change the rate from 0.25x to 10.00x. (These functions are not supported by official APP)
